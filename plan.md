Button for X
Button for YT Shorts

When you click the button it seperates you into the window which we will discuss how this should work. Add a back button.

# X Feed
I want to automate finding images, gifs & videos
I want to automate adding the text to these, have like three formats example "Anime Name (Date it Aired)"
I want to automate having it combine them together
I want to automate having them scheduled on X for certain days / hours

# YT Shorts Feed
I want to automate downloading anime 
I want to automate making 30 second or less clips from these anime using my OBS settings
    -Downloading raw anime would be better especially for openings
I want to automate it uploading them to YouTube with title/description/Not for Children/Date
    Date will be easy because we will have it check for what last day the upload was and then upload it for the next day


# Additional Notes
Redact removes your followers without you having to go to the website. Figure out how they accomplish this task.
If we want to have it find images & gifs we need to have a very good webscraper in this program.
    -this program might be massive so let's make sure organization is our biggest priority.
    -seperate folders for xContent & ytShortsContent
